## Diagrams (Mermaid)

- Use Mermaid for diagrams
- Please remember to wrap node labels in double quotes when they contain special characters such as parentheses (), asterisks (\*), ampersands (&), or any other punctuation marks that could be interpreted as mermaid syntax. For example, use `A["Main Application"]` instead of `A[Main Application]`
- Use simple, clean diagrams (no custom colors or styles)
